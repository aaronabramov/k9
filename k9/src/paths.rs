// This is a hack to work around the issue with project root path resolution when

// When using a `file!()` macro in a crate that is a part of a workspace it will return
// a relative path from the worspace root.
// At the same time CARGO_MANIFEST env variable with hold the value of the crate's Cargo.toml
// path and not the workspace Cargo.toml.
//
// e.g.
//    /home
//        my_project/
//          Cargo.toml    <---- worspace definition
//          nested_crate/
//              Cargo.toml    <---------- other project's manifest
//              lib.rs      <------- file!() macro used here
//
//
// `file()` macro will return "my_project/nested_crate/lib.rs"
// and CARGO_MANIFEST will contain "/home/my_project"
//
// In the end we want to find the absolute path to the file, which is
//      `/home/my_project/nested_crate/lib.rs`
//
//
// There's probably a better solution for this problem, but after 20 min of research
// the sketchy workaround i found is to just join two paths while also removing the
// overlapping part.
//
// Technically this can be a bit dangerous, since the joining part may resolve in
// another existing file that is not the file we're looking for (esp if trying to
// resolve some generic file names like `lib.rs`) but the risk should be fairly minimal.
